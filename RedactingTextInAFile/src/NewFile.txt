Shazam Entertainment, Ltd. was started in 2000 with theidea of providing a ******* that could connect people tomusic by recognizing music in the environment by usingtheir mobile phones to recognize the music directly. Thealgorithm had to be able to recognize a short audio sampleof music that had been broadcast, mixed with heavyambient noise, subject to reverb and other processing,captured by a little cellphone microphone, subjected tovoice codec compression, and network dropouts, all beforearriving at our servers. The algorithm also had to performthe recognition quickly over a large database of music withnearly 2M tracks, and furthermore have a low number offalse positives while having a high recognition rate.This was a hard *******, and at the time there were noalgorithms known to us that could satisfy all theseconstraints. We eventually developed our own techniquethat met all the operational constraints [1].We have deployed the algorithm to scale in our commercialmusic recognition *******, with over 1.8M tracks in thedatabase. The ******* is currently live in Germany,Finland, and the UK, with over a half million users, andwill soon be available in ********** countries in Europe,Asia, and the USA. The user experience is as follows: Auser hears music playing in the environment. She calls upour ******* using her mobile phone and samples up to 15seconds of audio. An identification is performed on thesample at our server, then the track title and artist are sentback to the user via SMS text messaging. The informationis also made available on a web site, where the user mayregister and log in with her mobile phone number andpassword. At the web site, or on a smart phone, the usermay view her tagged track list and buy the CD. The usermay also download the ringtone corresponding to thetagged track, if it is available. The user may also send a30-second clip of the song to a friend. Other *******s, suchas purchasing an MP3 download may become availablesoon.A variety of similar consumer *******s has sprung uprecently. Musiwave has deployed a similar mobile-phonemusic identification ******* on the Spanish mobile carrierAmena using Philipsâ€™ robust hashing algorithm [2-4].Using the algorithm from Relatable, Neuros has included asampling feature on their MP3 player which allows a userto collect a 30-second sample from the built-in radio, thenlater plug into an online server to identify the music [5,6].Audible Magic uses the Muscle Fish algorithm to offer theClango ******* for identifying audio streaming from aninternet radio station [7-9].The Shazam algorithm can be used in many applicationsbesides just music recognition over a mobile phone. Due tothe ability to dig deep into noise we can identify musichidden behind a loud voiceover, such as in a radio advert.On the other hand, the algorithm is also very fast and canbe used for copyright monitoring at a search speed of over1000 times realtime, thus enabling a modest server tomonitor significantly many media streams. The algorithmis also suitable for content-based cueing and indexing forlibrary and archival uses.
